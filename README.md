# WAPS BUDGET STUDY

Reading in census data can be a very stressful task, Especially with how data is organized.
For my final project in DSCI 310 I took on the opportunity to visualize the budget of the Winona Area Public School, 
This opened me to learn some very important tools that are necessary to be able to scrape data. Some of these things were: 

(1). Using Tabula to scrape PDF Files. 
(2). Using R and dplyr to find strange values and changing them if it is interpretable
(3). Using dplyr to merge datasets after it is structured.
